        <p>
            Tuhfat al-Kiram — primarily, a chronicle of Sufis in Sindh by Mir Ali Sher Qaune Thattvi (c. mid-eighteenth century) — that one Bilawal Shah Noorani of Thatta was afflicted by divine frenzy, and had to leave the town in the late fifteenth century during the reign of Jam Nizamuddin II.
